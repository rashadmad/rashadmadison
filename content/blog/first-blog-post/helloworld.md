# So What Have I Been Up To
Hello, I'm Rashad I'm a passionate developer with strong design skills. I have decided to start journaling my experiences as an engineer and creator. I think I have a non-traditional path to the world of engineering. I have some crazy stories to tell.

 
Recently, I lost my job with JPMorgan Chase after almost three years.

It always sucks to connect with folks, figure out ways to contribute to a team and have to start over. On the other hand developing one's self and taking on new challenges are exciting and essential for keeping rust from forming.

## I Can Help Your Business GROWWWW

I am taking this time to connect with small business and assisting them in developing there online brand. Freelancing can be challenging but I love working with people and assiting them in chasing there dreams.
  
> Since losing my job, I have been reflecting on my career path and considering this as an opportunity to steer my career in the direction it should go.



Logos are powerful building blocks for your online brand. I create logos that look great on t-shirts and on social media profiles. The key is design with vectors. Vector logo designed professionally are future proof and can go any where and still look good. 

  

Here is my logo:

## Tailor Made & Bespoke Designs

I designed my logo to be a kind of mascot that l can be trusted with there technology needs. Though my logo is very stylized I am capable of many types of designs and can create a logo for you that is tailored to you and your clients needs.
  

I also have interest in developing a 3D version of this soon keep and eye out for that. 3D is a powerful way to communicate a strong and professional brand. I plan on doing a future blog post showing how I go about developing 3D
