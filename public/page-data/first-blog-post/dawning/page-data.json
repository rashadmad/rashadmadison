I have decided to start journaling my experiences as an engineer and creator, particularly as someone with a highly non-traditional path to the world of engineering. Recently, I lost my job with JPMorgan Chase after almost three years.\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since losing my job, I have been reflecting on my career path and considering this as an opportunity to steer my career in the direction it should go. I know I am talented in many different dimensions, and I need to showcase that and monetize it. <br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I plan on taking my logo here:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://rashad-madison-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rashad_logo.svg\" alt=\"Logo\"></p>\n<p>and creating a 3D version of it. I will animate it and give it a nice setting and 3D UI. There is a growing demand for 3D skills combined with JavaScript expertise, and I will be discussing my adventures in this area here on my blog.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://threejs.org/files/projects/junni.png\" alt=\"threejs\"></p>\n<p>I am also planning to create an eCommerce site featuring Afrocentric avant-garde art, showcasing some of the work I have been creating over the last few years. During COVID, I returned to art as a way to cope and for therapy. Here are some examples on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rashaddraws/\">My Instagram</a></p>\n<p>In addition, I am freelancing, creating logos, websites, and assisting folks in building their online brands.</p>\n<p>I am quite excited about the new website you are visiting right now. Thank you for showing interest in me and my work. I consider myself a pretty interesting individual with plenty to share. I look forward to sharing my musings and works in progress with you. If you are in need of a software engineer and artist, let me know.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","author":"Rashad J Madison","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1528716321680-815a8cdb8cbe?q=80&w=2565&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D","date":"Invalid date","description":"my name is Rashad and I have something to say.
